    description:
      "Mr. Danish Raza Rizvi along with Shivank Tripathi and Md. Nafis Khan developed the Students Attendance Manager Mobile App. Manual process of attendance management consumes a lot of time and paper resources. To prevent this, they introduced a system that consists of an android app with its web interface and for teacher and students. In this system, the students register themselves with their device and connect to the server. Application scans for the devices connected to the specific server in their local network without any manual intervention and marks them present in the database. This enable us to save a lot of time, help in storing record and also to track attendance.",
